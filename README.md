# Warning
I highly suggest you don't run your own instance as lolbot's official instance is 24/7 and there is no place for a self-hosted instance. However,

# if you wanna run it...

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Some python modules (`pip install -Ur requirements.txt`)
- A text editor
- Knowledge on how to maintain the bot

## Running

1. `git clone https://github.com/xshotD/lolbot`
2. `cd lolbot`
3. `nano config.json` (follow the comments beginning with `//`)
4. `python3.6 index.py` 

Addendum 4a: use screen: `screen -DmS python3.6 index.py`

Addendum 4b: use pm2: `pm2 start index.py --name lolbot --interpreter python3.6` (this is currently used in production)

### Features probably never added
- music
- something else (???)
